# Nortal - Shiny App Example - Interactive Map  

Repo contains a relatively simple example of what's possible with Shiny Apps and interactive maps. In this particular instance a Leaflet based interactive map is used to display the following data for CitiBike in North Jersey from June 2022. A link to the app is available [here](https://nortaldata.shinyapps.io/CitiBikeNJ/)

### Key Details 

* Location of each CitiBike station (based on Longitude and Latitude coordinates) represented by a blue circle 
* Blue circles show relative size of each station based on number of departing trips 
* Clicking a blue circle shows a pop up with the name of the station and the number of departing trips 
* Users can zoom in, scroll around the map and drill down into a specific station 
* Uses an accurate map that allows a user to see all street names, highways, major landmarks and businesses
